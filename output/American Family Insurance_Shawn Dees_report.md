## Company Overview
Subject: Strategic Engagement with Shawn Dees at American Family Insurance

Dear Team,

Shawn Dees at American Family Insurance is likely focused on maintaining the positive momentum after the turnaround from losses in previous years, ensuring stability after the downgrade by Moody's, and increasing their competitive edge in the market. Their challenges may include sustaining the underwriting profit, managing the increased capital strain, and maintaining customer relations given the internal controversy tied with their Direct Repair Program (DRP).

American Family Insurance has been investing in technology, demonstrated by their recent partnership with Empathy Platform and the spin-off of the PropTech startup Fixle. This presents an opportunity for us to offer our advanced technological solutions to aid their digital transformations, streamline their operations, and improve customer experience.

Furthermore, we can help reinforce their commitment to their employees and community as demonstrated by raising their minimum hourly wage and response to natural disasters. Our employee engagement and social responsibility programs can align with their strategies, fostering better working environments and strengthening their community relations.

In addition, we can leverage our risk management expertise to help American Family Insurance address the capital strain highlighted by Moody's, helping boost their financial stability and reputation in the industry.

We should approach Shawn with a clear, actionable plan on how our offerings align with American Family Insurance's needs and strategic priorities. Our goal is to offer solutions that can assist them in maintaining their recent underwriting profit, mitigating risk, advancing their digital transformation, enhancing their employee engagement, and strengthening their community ties.

Best Regards,
[Your Name]
